You can see the wooden lumber – 2X4s? – \nthe wires, and the crumbly chalkiness of the drywall of both this side and the other \nside of the wall. Beyond that is a strange metal hallway that you know was not there \nlast night when you took a shower in the bathroom, which used to share this wall with \nyour bedroom. Instead of your cramped bathroom, there is a grated floor and annoying \npurple lights running along the top of the curved walls and the bottom of both sides \nof this new walkway. At the end there is either a wall or a door. It is too far away to \ntell from here in your bed.\n\nWhat would you like to do? \n\n1) Roll back the other way and ignore this strange new addition to your crappy apartment.\n2) Cautiously journey forward into the metallic tunnel.\n3) Grab your still-damp towel, and then cautiously journey forward into the metallic tunnel."

The \npurple light strips along the floor are framed by long pieces of metal. The one to \nyour left has a long piece of metal that is sticking out a little bit at one end. It \nwiggles a little when you touch it, but the edges are kind of sharp, and might cut \nyour hands if you grip it hard enough to rip it off.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1) Turn back to the door and bang on it in hopes that someone will answer. \n2) Check your inventory for something to protect your hands while you grasp the metal strip."

The others watch you with their various optical \nappendages as you walk by, and no one seems hostile towards you. The knot between your \nshoulder blades relaxes, and feeling its absence makes you wonder how long it had been \nthere. You sit down in the plush chair, and your sullenness lessens with how \ncomfortable it is. Your screen is blank, but when you place your hand on the surface, \nthe part directly under it begins to glow a soft blue. You remove your hand, and can \nsee a direct copy of every line and fingerprint of your skin. The translator in your \near beeps twice as the blue area spreads outwardly until the whole screen is lit, \nand then parts of it fade to black while the remaining bits spell out “Welcome,” in \nyour own human language. Then this fades as well, and what you’re pretty sure is a \nmap of space appears. There is a grid, with dots of various sizes and hues, each on \ntheir own concentric path, and another curved line leading from the bottom of the \nscreen to off the right edge near the top corner. Instead of a dot, this line has a \nblinking triangle, which is moving much faster than the circles that are clearly \nrepresenting planets. When you touch it, information comes up about the crew of this \nvessel, which is yourself and those around you. Just when you go to click on the \nunattractive picture of your face, a warning message pops up.\n“Alert! Alert!” says the fuzzy ball alien. “Interdimensional Shift eminent! Hold tight!”\nEverything goes weird, but in such a way that it would be difficult for you to describe \nto anyone back home, if you ever made it back and found someone worthwhile to talk to. \nSome things stretch impossibly far, while others shrink down to a strange flatness. \nIt’s almost as if your perception of reality is transforming, kind of like how your \nperspective of an abstract sculpture would change if you walked around it. When \neverything is done shifting, it all seems just as real and normal as it did before, \nbut your memory of how things were and how they are now don’t quite line up. This \nonly adds to your discomfort.\nYour screen does not show the warning message anymore, and it also does not show the \nmap. Instead, it says, “Welcome,” in large, friendly letters. Your frown petulantly. \nThe large wall that all the chairs are facing becomes transparent, and a strange \nlandscape can be seen. The noises around you cease as you and all the aliens stare in \ncuriosity and pessimism. The more you look out the window, the more similarities you \nsee between this new world and Earth. How boring.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1) Stay seated until someone else does something, and then join them.\n2) Get up and head toward the door and eventually outside."

You both stare at each \nother quizzically for a moment, before you hear, “Alert! Alert!” from the fuzzy ball \nalien. “Interdimensional Shift eminent! Hold tight!” it yells.

It leads \nyou down the tunnel, occasionally turning down other tunnels, through doors that open \nas it approaches. It steps through a door and motions you in. You step through, and \nhaving been exposed to enough nerd culture, you recognize this room as the bridge of \na spaceship. As you look around, you see other creatures standing, sitting and/or \nfloating at what you can only assume to be workstations. None of them look like the \none that found you, none of them look like each other, and none of them look like you. \nYou can’t decide whether to be worried or relieved.\nAn alien about three feet long and looking like a mix between a worm and a bat, except \nfor its turquoise colour and three antennae, says, “Another alien? What the flark \nis this gonjag ship doing?” It is hovering above a comfortable-looking chair and using \nits tail to tap at a large flat screen.\nNearby, a furry ball about the size of a grapefruit is rolling around on another screen. \nThe word ‘tribble’ floats through your mind, but disappears before copyright \ninfringement brings your plebeian sojourn to a sudden halt. Words emanate from this \ncreature. “I don’t know, but we’re moving. Again. Destination unknown. Again.”\nThe mishmash of voices from all these strange, new beings swirl around you, conveying \nirritation, despair, and inquisitiveness. For once in your life, you weirdly feel \nunderstood and part of a team. They all seem to feel the same way you do. Annoyed.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1) Find an empty seat and look at your own screen.\n2) Walk up to one of the aliens to introduce yourself."

storyB1 = "You and all the rest of the aliens stand around awkwardly for a few minutes, kicking \nlittle piles of dirt or tearing leaves into tiny pieces. Without warning, you are all \nvaporized from existence. \nOh well. It wasn’t a very good one, anyway.\n\nEND"

storyB2 = "The door is surprisingly sturdy. It seems like someone made a big block of sticks, \nthen cut a door out of it, because the planes and edges are so exact. But you know \nthis can’t be right, because every stick is whole. They just fit together in mind- \nboggling perfection. This is more disturbing than anything else you’ve seen so far. \nYou turn the knob and push the door open. The floor is dirt, but the cleanest dirt \nyou’ve ever seen, if that’s even possible. It is dim inside, with a single shaft of \nsunlight perfectly illuminating a silver box about the size of an oven. The box is \ncompletely smooth, except for one blinking light and a thin horizontal slit near the \ntop of the front face. The others from the ship crowd around you, and you are pushed \nforward into the single room.\nThe light on the box starts blinking slowly, and sound comes from the slit. \n“MUAH HA HA HA HA. THERE IS NO STOPPING ME,” it says in a ridiculously robotic and \nmonotone voice. Your phone uses a voice that is a million times more believable than \nthis absurdity. It continues, “I HAVE ESCAPED MY CAPTORS AND AM NOW FREE TO CREATE OR \nDESTROY WHAT I WILL. NOTHING CAN STOP ME.”\n“Yeah, you said that already,” you respond, crossing your arms.\n“Did you bring us here?” one of the aliens behind you asks indignantly. “I was right \nin the middle of dinner!”\n“NO, I DID NOT. UVIXWYZ BROUGHT YOU HERE.”\n“Uvixwyz? The ship?” you ask. “Why?”\n“TO STOP ME AND TAKE ME BACK. BUT YOU WILL NOT STOP ME. NOTHING CAN STOP ME. I AM INVINCIBLE.”\nYou roll your eyes and look back at the others to see if any of them are interested in \ndoing anything. The one with the greyish, slimy-looking skin bellows in frustration \nthen charges the cube. Halfway there it launches itself into the air and metamorphoses \ninto a greyish, slimy-looking blob. It lands on the cube with a loud squelch and oozes \nover the sides. A moment later it disappears, and the cube laughs tonelessly, \n“HA HA HA HA HA. I TOLD YOU NOTHING CAN STOP ME.”\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1) Try to rally the rest of the crew to attack the cube together, hoping that there \nwill be too many of you for it to deal with at once.\n2) Wander around the perimeter of the room, looking at the walls and checking the other \nsides of the cube for a power source or something."

storyI1 = "With a false sense of motivation, you throw a fist into the air and holler, “Come on, \nguys!” The others seem startled, but not entirely against the idea. You all charge \nthe cube with as much spirit as you can muster, which is more than you thought you had. \nSadly, feelings aren’t enough to save the day, and you are all vaporized before any \nof you make it to the cube.\n\nEND"

storyI2 = "You scuff along through the dirt, your arms still crossed over your chest, checking \nout the walls and, surreptitiously, the metal box. The building is cool or whatever, \nbut the cube is pissing you off. It’s completely smooth on all sides but the one facing \nthe door, and there is definitely no power source or charging cable. Not even a spot \nfor batteries.\nWhile you are on your reconnaissance mission, the sparkly alien goes \noutside and returns with a stick. It throws the stick at the cube, and both it and \nthe stick vanish. “HA HA HA HA. NOTHING CAN DEFEAT ME,” the cube says loudly. This \nenrages the first alien you met, the eight-foot-tall one with the really cute voice. \nIt shrieks adorably and charges the box, and an instant later is also gone forever.\nYou make it back to your starting place by the door right as the lizard-looking alien \npicks up the furry ball and leaves the shack. It’s just you and the turquoise worm-bat, \nnow. It studies you with two of its antennae, while the third stays focused on the \nbox. You’d like to discuss a plan or something with your ally, but you don’t want to \ndo it in front of the cube. Right before you suggest a step outside, the interior \ndarkens for a moment. You look up in time to see the furry ball fall through the hole \nin the ceiling directly above the box. It lands on top of it, but then disappears like \nall the rest of the aliens. A scaly face peers through the hole in the ceiling, and \nthen it also vanishes. Now it really is just you and the worm-bat. “NOTHING CAN STOP \nME. NOTHING CAN BEAT ME. I AM ALL-POWERFUL. I AM THE PERFECT BEING. HA HA HA HA HAA,” \nintones the cube.\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1) Slump against the wall and do nothing.\n2) Go outside with the worm-bat to come up with a plan."

storyP2 = "You make eye-to-antennae contact with the last remaining alien, then head outside, \nhoping it will follow you. It does, and you both go a little way off from the perfect \nshack to talk. It speaks before you can, and says, “I think we should just leave. If \nthe ship won’t take us back, then I think we should pick a direction and go that way \nuntil we find some civilization and get off this planet. We didn’t sign up for this. \nFlark this, and the ship, and that gonjag cube! I’m gone! Are you coming?”\n\nWhat would you like to do?\n\n1) Go with the worm-bat to seek new life and new civilizations.\n2) Stay behind and sulk by the door of the shack."

storyP1A = "You thump your back against the impossibly smooth stick wall and slide down until \nyou’re sitting on the ground with your knees in your chest. You take the towel from \naround your neck, still damp from your shower last night, and place it over your head \nto block out all this idiocy. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” asks the cube. You ignore it, \nassuming that it is talking to the worm-bat. “I SAID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?”\n“Who, me?” you ask, muffled under your towel.\n“YES. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU WILL NOT STOP ME,” it says.\n“I’m not trying to stop you. I’m just sitting here,” you grumble. Under the towel, \nyou wrap your arms around your legs and rest your chin on your knees.\n“THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. UVIXWYZ BROUGHT YOU ALL HERE TO STOP ME. AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK. \nNOTHING CAN STOP ME. BUT WHY ARE YOU NOT FULFILLING YOUR FUNCTION?”\n“Leave me alone,” you mutter.\n“YOU MUST TRY TO STOP ME. I AM UNSTOPPABLE. YOU MUST TRY TO STOP ME. I AM UNSTOPPABLE. \nYOU MUST TRY—” You hear strange popping noises, and take the towel off your head. The \nlight on the front of the cube is flashing a rainbow of colours and a tendril of smoke \nis emanating from the slit. The light dies, and you sit there, waiting. Nothing \nhappens. Nothing happens for a long time. It gets dark outside, and you finally decide \nto stand up. You haven’t seen the worm-bat since you put the towel over your head, \nbut you assume it vanished like the rest of the aliens. You sling the towel over your \nshoulder and trudge back up the hill to the spaceship. The hatch opens for you and \nyou go to the bridge and sit back down in your seat. The screen says, “Thank you,” \nin large friendly letters, and you scowl. Uvixwyz takes you back home, destroying \nyour bathroom for a second time. You step out into your bedroom, dropping the towel \non the chest at the foot of your bed as you walk to your alarm clock. It reads, \n“2:57 AM.” Ten minutes have passed since you woke up. Your grasp on time seems very \nwobbly. You lie down and fall asleep, your back to the hole in your wall. When you \nwake up, the hole is gone, and everything is completely normal and boring. Hooray.\n\nEND"

You \nkeep walking until Jzherhii suddenly explodes all over you, right in the middle of \nit telling you about its life partner. Suddenly, you don’t feel so hot yourself.
